I only have small pieces of it now.  I woke up very fulfilled and that's great.  I remember changing something.  I remember resolving something.  
I remember feeling something important.  Something was happening that mattered.  It's hard when a dream just leaves you with impressions.  Sometimes I can
still remember, but it's a practice.  It's about living in the moment rather than what's in store for you the rest of the day.  And that makes it hard.

I got scared about writing here, but I've decided it's okay.  I need this.  I need it to be somewhere where I can always find it. If someone else does, fine.
I never plan on doing political things.  So I don't care.  It's not like I'm racist or something.  There are just my personal thoughts and feelings.
And that's fine.  It keeps me sane.  However, I think from now on my friends will remain nameless.  This seems safer, for everyone.  I will know who I refer
to based on context.  Of course, I won't tell you who the keys are.  So unless you know me, you won't understand.  This seems safe enough. 

Well anyway, where was I?  I believe I was talking about dreams and what they mean.  Well.  Dreams are cool.  So anyway.  What was I dreaming about?  
It's not lost.  It's just not there anymore.  The chasm between that brain activity and long term memory is gone.  I didn't reinforce that world.  
How much do we forget?  And does it matter, if you can't feel it, not for real.  I am simply questioning it.  I think when I see something on a show
or in a movie and the main character restores the world to how it was before, just to save one person. Like for instance on futurama.  Well, doesn't that
matter?  I think it does.
